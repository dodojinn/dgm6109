      <h1>Cold Days, Warm Meals</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> On colder days, I eat more total calories.
      </p>

      <p>
        This scatterplot compares my average daily temperature (°C) on the
        X-axis and my total calorie intake (kcal) on the Y-axis. Each circle
        represents one day in my dataset. Besides these two main factors, I also
        show how many meals I ate and how strongly food affected my emotions.
        Bubble size shows
        <strong>meals per day</strong>: smaller bubbles represent days when I
        ate 2 meals, and larger bubbles show days when I ate 3 meals. Bubble
        color shows my <strong>emotional impact after eating</strong> on a 1-5
        scale. These extra elements help me see not just whether I eat more on
        cold days, but also how I spread my meals and how “comforting” the food
        feels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the visualization, many of the colder days on the left side
        of the chart sit higher on the Y-axis, which means my total calories are
        often higher when the average temperature is low. However, the pattern
        is not perfect: there are a few warmer days with high calorie intake and
        a few colder days where I still ate less. The larger bubbles (3 meals)
        appear slightly more often on cold days, and several darker circles
        (higher emotional impact) also appear on cold, high-calorie days. From
        this dataset, I would say that colder weather <strong>tends</strong> to
        push my calories up and increase emotional or comfort eating, but other
        factors like mood, schedule, and cravings also play a role.
