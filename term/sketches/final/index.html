    <h1>Three Visualization Proposals</h1>
    <p><b>Name:</b> Jingjing Fang</p>

    <h2>About My Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      I recorded my daily life for 30 days, focusing on how weather and
      temperature affect my eating habits and emotional state.
    </p>

    <p>The dataset includes the following fields:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>High Temp (°C)</li>
      <li>Low Temp (°C)</li>
      <li>Weather Type</li>
      <li>Total Calorie Intake (kcal)</li>
      <li>Meals per Day</li>
      <li>% of Hot Meals</li>
      <li>Emotional Impact (0-5)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proposal 1 - Bubble Plot</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Hypothesis:</b> As the daily temperature decreases, my total calorie
      intake increases. Colder weather also makes me prefer hot meals, and my
      mood tends to drop slightly on those days.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Data Fields:</b> Low Temp (°C), Total Calorie Intake (kcal), % of Hot
      Meals, Emotional Impact (0-5)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Visual Encoding:</b> X = Low Temp (°C), Y = Total Calories (kcal),
      Bubble Size = % of Hot Meals, Bubble Color = Emotional Impact (blue = low,
      yellow = high)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> To explore how colder temperatures influence both eating
      habits and emotional changes through a simple but clear scatter-based
      visualization.

    <h2>Proposal 2 - Weather Mood Calendar</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Hypothesis:</b> My emotional intensity changes with different weather
      types — I usually feel calmer on sunny days and lower on rainy ones. On
      days with lower mood, I tend to eat more meals, which appears as a larger
      color area inside each calendar square.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Data Fields:</b> Date, Weather, Emotional Impact (0-5), Meals per Day
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Visual Encoding:</b> X = Date (calendar layout), Y = Weather Type,
      Color Hue = Weather, Color Opacity = Emotion (higher opacity = stronger
      emotion), Color Fill Area = Meals per Day (larger area = more meals)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> To visualize daily mood and meal patterns through color
      transparency and area size in a compact, diary-like calendar format.
    </p>

    <h2>Proposal 3 - Mood Orbit</h2>

    <p>
      <b>Hypothesis:</b> Days with moderate temperature tend to cluster toward
      higher mood and balanced calorie intake, forming a calm outer orbit. As
      temperature becomes extreme — either very cold or very hot — the pattern
      moves inward, where mood drops and calorie intake rises.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Data Fields:</b> Weather, High Temp (°C) / Low Temp (°C), Emotional
      Impact (0-5), Total Calorie Intake (kcal), % of Hot Meals
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Visual Encoding:</b> The center of the chart represents four main
      weather types — sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy. Circular orbits around
      the center represent temperature zones: the outer rings show warmer days,
      and the inner rings show colder days. Each point on an orbit corresponds
      to one day. The color of each point encodes mood (blue = low, yellow =
      high), and its distance from the center represents total calorie intake
      (further = more calories). The opacity of each point reflects the
      percentage of hot meals (higher opacity = higher proportion of hot meals).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Goal:</b> To express the relationship between weather, temperature,
      emotion, and calorie intake through an orbital metaphor. The arrangement
      allows viewers to easily distinguish between balanced “healthy days” in
      the outer orbits and stressful, irregular days closer to the center.

    <h3>Credits / References</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a> inspired me to
      use symbolic and emotional visual metaphors. It made me realize that
      weather and mood are not only data but also personal experiences that can
      be shown through color and rhythm.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com">Data-to-Viz</a> helped me choose the
      right chart forms and understand which structures are better for comparing
      multiple variables, especially when combining categorical (weather) and
      numerical (temperature, calories) data.

      <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery">Observable D3 Gallery</a>
      gave me ideas about layout and spacing. Although I did not use any code,
      its circular and calendar-based examples helped me plan the overall
      organization of my designs.
