        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>
          This project asks a simple question:
          <strong>Does daily temperature affect how much I eat?</strong>
          I wanted to see if colder or warmer days change my total calorie
          intake and how I feel.
        </p>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >As temperature decreases, the total amount of food I consume
            increases.</strong

        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I collected data for the last month of the term. For each day, I
          recorded the high and low temperature (in °C), total calories I ate
          that day (in kcal), how many meals I had, the percentage of hot meals,
          my emotional impact from 1 (very low) to 5 (very strong), and a short
          weather note.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the bubble scatterplot, the
          <strong>x-axis</strong> shows the average temperature for the day, the
          <strong>y-axis</strong> shows my total calories, bubble
          <strong>size</strong> shows how many meals I ate, and bubble
          <strong>color</strong> shows my emotional impact from light to dark
          red.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collected one row of data per day for 28 days. This gave me enough
          points to see general trends even though it is still a small personal
          dataset.
        </p>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2>Summarize</h2>
        <p>
          My calorie intake stays in a similar range, but there is a small
          tendency for slightly cooler days to have higher calories. Emotional
          impact does not follow a simple pattern: strong emotions appear on
          both lower and mid temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually, most bubbles fall between roughly 1200 and 1800 kcal, and
          there is no strong upward or downward trend across the full
          temperature range. Darker bubbles, representing stronger emotional
          impact, are scattered throughout rather than forming a specific
          cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on what the visualization shows, my first idea that “cold days always make me eat much
          more” is only partly true. Other factors such as schedule, stress, or
          mood likely also influence how much I eat.
