        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>
          This project asks a simple question:
          <strong>Does daily temperature affect how much I eat?</strong>
          I wanted to see if colder or warmer days change my total calorie
          intake and how I feel.
        </p>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >As temperature decreases, the total amount of food I consume
            increases.</strong

        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I recorded daily data for <strong>approximately 10 weeks</strong>,
          Even though I tracked everything until December, the last couple of
          weeks were really hectic—no exams, but a lot of stress—so my eating
          patterns became unstable. Including all of that data also made the
          bubbles very dense and hard to read. To keep the visualization clear
          and closer to my usual habits, I decided to
          <strong>filter out all data after November 15</strong>. For each day,
          I recorded the high and low temperature (in °C), total calories I ate
          that day (in kcal), how many meals I had, the percentage of hot meals,
          my emotional impact from 1 (very low) to 5 (very strong), and a short
          weather note.
        </p>
        <p>In the bubble scatterplot, the</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>x-axis</strong> shows the average temperature for the day
          </li>
          <li><strong>y-axis</strong> shows my total calories</li>
          <li>bubble <strong>size</strong> shows how many meals I ate</li>
          <li>
            bubble <strong>color</strong> shows my emotional impact from light
            to dark red.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I collected one row of data per day for 10 weeks. This gave me enough
          points to see general trends even though it is still a small personal
          dataset.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          My calorie intake stays in a similar range, but there is a small
          tendency for slightly cooler days to have higher calories. Emotional
          impact does not follow a simple pattern: strong emotions appear on
          both lower and mid temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually, most bubbles fall between roughly 1200 and 1800 kcal, and
          there is no strong upward or downward trend across the full
          temperature range. Darker bubbles, representing stronger emotional
          impact, are scattered throughout rather than forming a specific
          cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on what the visualization shows, my first idea that “cold days
          always make me eat much more” is only partly true. Other factors such
          as schedule, stress, or mood likely also influence how much I eat.
