        How temperature affects my total calorie intake and hot meal preference
      </h1>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As temperature decreases, total calorie
        intake increases, and the percentage of hot meals also rises.

        Each circle represents a day. The <strong>x-axis</strong> shows the
        average temperature (°C), the <strong>y-axis</strong> shows total
        calorie intake (kcal), the <strong>circle size</strong> shows
        temperature range, and the <strong>circle color</strong> represents hot
        meal percentage.

        This visualization became one of my favorite projects because it shows
        how much my understanding of D3.js has improved. I learned how to
        control layout and spacing by setting margins and scales carefully, and
        I started to think more about visual balance and clarity. Instead of
        relying on built-in functions, I drew the axes and labels myself, which
        helped me understand how every part of the chart fits together. I also
        enjoyed using color and circle size to represent real meanings in my
        data, turning technical coding into something expressive and personal.
