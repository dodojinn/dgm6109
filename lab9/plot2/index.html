        How emotional impact relates to my meals, temperature, and hot meal preference
      </h1>

      <!-- Hypothesis -->
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Stronger emotional impact may relate to more meals per day, 
        and external factors like temperature may also influence hot meal choices.
      </p>

      <!-- Chart explanation -->
      <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">
        Each circle represents a day. The <strong>x-axis</strong> shows emotional impact (0-5), 
        the <strong>y-axis</strong> shows meals per day (0-4), 
        the <strong>circle size</strong> represents hot meal percentage, and the 
        <strong>circle color</strong> represents temperature (cool → warm → hot).
        To reduce outliers, days with only one meal were removed using 
        <strong>Array.filter()</strong>.

        This visualization helped me understand how different dataset properties
        can be layered together in a single scatterplot. I practiced combining
        color, size, and filtered subsets to reveal patterns more clearly. Using
        <strong>Array.filter()</strong> allowed me to remove one-meal days that
        acted as outliers, which made the overall relationship easier to read.
        I also learned how thoughtful color choices and consistent spacing can
        improve the clarity and mood of a visualization, helping the chart feel
        both readable and expressive.
